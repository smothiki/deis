# Deis Mesos Subsystem

The Mesos subsystem for Deis includes containers required to support
scheduling Deis application containers using Marathon.

## Containers

The Mesos meta-component is comprised of four containers:

* [mesos-zk](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/mesos-zk/) - Zookeeper cluster for use by Mesos
* [mesos-master](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/mesos-master/) - Mesos master used to coordinate cluster resources
* [mesos-marathon](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/mesos-marathon/) - Marathon framework used for scheduling
* [mesos-slave](https://index.docker.io/u/deis/mesos-slave/) - Mesos slave used to dispatch work on the data plane

Master and slave images are based on [mesos-base](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/mesos/base) image,
which is a containerized Mesos environment.

## Usage

Please consult the [Makefile](Makefile) for current instructions on how to build, test, push,
install, and start **deis/mesos**.
